Introduction
============

Background
----------

I wrote this library to help people webscrape using my companion website http://www.learnwebscraping.com.  This library does not include follow-on parsing of data, but simply retrieves it and provide a few nuances that other fetching libraries do not include.  These features include Proxy pool generation and cookie imports from browsers.


Install
-------

Some options to install the webscraping package:

#. Checkout the repository: https://github.com/alexanderward/simplewebscraper
#. Download the zip: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplewebscraper
#. Install with pypi: *pip install simplewebscraper*

The only dependency is python 2.7 or higher.
